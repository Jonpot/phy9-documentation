# PHY9 Super Server Admin Documentation

This is a guide for administrators and moderators working on the UC Davis Physics 9 Series Discord Server.

## Getting Started

This guide assumes that you already have administrator privileges on the server. This requires one of the following roles:

* The yellow `Server Moderator` role.
* The gray `Blitz` role.
* The Blue `Bots` role.

**Note** that the pink `Professor` role is not sufficient. One of the basic pillars of the community is that it is for students, run by students. It is only because Blitz is especially familiar with Discord that it is more efficient if he is granted administrator privileges as well.

**Note** also that this guide assumes some basic competency with using Discord.
