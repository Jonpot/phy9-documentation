# Community

### Server Insights

This feature allows **Administrators** to track the engagement and activity of the server, as well as view interesting demographical data.

### Membership Screening

Before a user can interact with the server, they must acknowledge a list of rules. These rules are a mix of UC Davis' code of conduct as well as Discord's EULA and Community Guidelines.

### Welcome Screen

After acknowledging the Membership Screening page, the Welcome Screen provides a brief set of instructors for how a user can use Carl-bot to gain access to the global and class-specific channels of their choice.
