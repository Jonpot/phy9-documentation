# Bots

### Carl-bot

Carl-bot is primarily used for reaction roles- the ability for a user to react to a message with a certain emoji and receive a new role with its associated permissions. Currently, this feature is employed in the \#welcome and \#class-selection channels. It can be managed by visiting [https://carl.gg/](https://carl.gg/) and logging in with Discord.

### Logger

Logger is an anti-cheating measure the admins have employed to keep the server honest. Logger keeps track of all messages that have been **deleted or** **edited** and reports the time and original content of that message in \#bot-log. It also tracks when users join or leave voice channels. It can be managed by **Administrators** using the "%" prefix in \#bot-log. Type `%help` in \#bot-log for additional help.

### **TeXit**

TeXit is a bot which allows users to render LaTeX on Discord by surrounding LaTeX syntax with $$. It can be managed by **Administrators** using the "," prefix in \#bot-log. Type `,help` in \#bot-log for additional help.
