# Channels

This guide will give an overview of the expected content for each of the expected channels. It will only mention permissions when the permissions of a channel differ from the category it is a part of. "Common Channels" are defined as channels that are either active, visited by most users, or are normally open. Channels are considered "Uncommon" if they have incredibly restricted access or are only open for small periods of time.

## Common Channels

### \#welcome

This channel is the first channel a new user sees. It contains the code of conduct that all Students must agree to through Carl-bot's reaction roles. This is where new rules should go, should they ever be required. This channel also contains the permanent invite link that users can use to invite others. @everyone can **view, read, and add reactions** in this channel, but only **Administrators** can **write** messages.

### \#announcements-🌐

This channel is used for server-wide and course-wide announcements. @everyone can **view, read, and add reactions** in this channel, but only **Administrators** can **write** messages.

### \#class-selection

This channel is the second channel a new user sees. It contains a message that allows students to select which class _section_ they are a part of through Carl-bot's reaction roles. @Students can **view, read, and add reactions** in this channel, but only **Administrators** can **write** messages.

### \#general-🌐

This channel is the primary stream of conversation for all physics-related topics.

### \#lab-🌐

This channel is used to talk about the logistics, methods, and results of the lab component of Physics 9 courses.

### \#resources-🌐

This channel is used to link useful videos, copies of textbooks, study guides, and other resources that students may find useful.

### \#highlights-🌐

This channel is used to document particularly memorable, funny, or jaw-dropping moments that occur, somehow related to Physics 9.

### \#off-topic-🌐

This channel is the primary stream of conversation for all non-physics-related topics.

### 🔊🪑 9C Global

This channel is the primary voice chat used for Physics 9 students to talk to each other.

### \#announcements \(Class and Section-Specific\)

This channel is used for Professors to give important updates about their class. @&lt;Professor&gt; Students can **view, read, and add reactions** in this channel, but only @&lt;Professor&gt;s and **Administrators** can **write** messages.

### Other Channels \(Class and Section-Specific\)

Professors have control over what other channels they would like in their specific categories, and most of them have names which makes their expected content self-evident.



## Uncommon Channels

### \#mod-chat

This channel is primarily used to discuss the logistical and administrative issues that are associated with the UCD Physics 9 server. **Administrators**, @Professors, and @TAs have access to **view, read, and write** in this channel.

### \#join-log

This channel automatically tracks the usernames and dates of entry of new users to the server. Only **Administrators** can view this channel.

### \#bot-log

This channel is used to interact with the various bots on the server. It also serves as the primary place for the Logger bot to function. Only **Administrators** can view this channel.

### \#&lt;professor&gt;-appreciation-channel

These channels serve as places for @&lt;Professor&gt; Students to write messages of appreciation towards notable professors. They are a rare case where @&lt;Professor&gt; Students _can_ **view, read, and write** in a channel that a @&lt;Professor&gt; cannot. At the end of the quarter, @&lt;Professor&gt;s should be given access to **view, read, and write** in these channels.

### \#scream-into-the-void

A rant channel, made public occasionally for students to scream into after a particularly bad exam. Generally, only **Administrators** can view this channel, but, during these certain events, @Students may be given access to **view, read, and write** _****_in this channel. @Professors should _not_ be given access to **view** this channel.
