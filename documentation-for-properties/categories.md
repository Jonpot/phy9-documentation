# Categories

## Common Categories

### &gt; MISC.

This category contains the \#mod-chat, \#join-log, and \#bot-log channels. This channel has no hierarchical permissions, so channels added to this category will need to have their permissions manually set. Channels should be added to this category when they are being first tested, or when they should otherwise never be seen by anyone other than the other admins.

### &gt; SERVER ANNOUNCEMENTS

This category contains the \#welcome, \#announcements-🌐, and \#class-selection channels. This channel has no hierarchical permissions, so channels added to this category will need to have their permissions manually set. There's really no reason to add additional channels to this category, apart from an eventual \#section-selection.

### &gt; GLOBAL CHANNELS

This category contains the \#general-🌐, \#lab-🌐, \#resources-🌐, \#highlights-🌐, \#off-topic-🌐, and 🔊🪑 9C Global channels. @Students and @Professors have access to **view, read, write, and connect** to all channels in this category.

### &gt; PHY 009X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt;

This category contains the various channels specific to a class, generally including \#announcements, \#general, \#homework, \#discussion, and 🔊🪑 9C &lt;Professor&gt; channels. @&lt;Professor&gt; Students and @&lt;Professor&gt;s have access to **view, read, write, and connect** to all channels in this category.

**Note** that the \#announcements channel has _specific_ permissions that prevent @&lt;Professor&gt; Students from **writing** messages. In Discord, _specific_ permissions always override _general_ permissions, like the ones that channels inherit from categories.

At the end of the quarter, all channels that follow this naming convention should be marked with \[ARCHIVED\] and have their permissions updated \(see below\).

## Uncommon Categories

### &gt; &lt;PROFESSOR&gt; - HW

This category is nearly identical to &gt; PHY 009X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt;, and only serves to help visually distinguish the channels in both. Generally, this category includes a channel for each homework question so that students may discuss \(e.g. \#hw-q1, \#hw-q2, ..., \#hw-qn\). @&lt;Professor&gt; Students and @&lt;Professor&gt;s have access to **view, read, write, and connect** to all channels in this category.

### &gt; PHY 009X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt; \[ARCHIVED\]

This category is reserved for &gt; PHY 009X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt; categories that were active _in the previous quarter_. This channel has no hierarchical permissions, so channels added to this category will need to have their permissions manually set. At the end of the quarter, all channels marked with \[ARCHIVED\] should be deleted.
