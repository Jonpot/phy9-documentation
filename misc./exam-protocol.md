# Exam Protocol

### Standard Protocol

If all PHY9X exams are taking place simultaneously, it is sufficient to simply tweak the @Student role, revoking permission to **write or connect** _****_in any channels. After all professors confirm it is alright to re-open the server in \#mod-chat, simply restore these permissions. It is generally advised to be very clear about what is happening through \#announcements-üåê.

### Potential Future Protocols

As the UCD Physics 9 server expands to include more classes, the likelihood that all the exams line up lessens. As such, it may be required in the future to give users permissions to **write and connect** with the @&lt;Professor&gt; Student role instead of the @Student role. Then, when that @&lt;Professor&gt; has an exam, only tweak the associated students' roles.

**Note** that there may be a potential exploit where a student uses Carl-bot to switch their class to another section to ask questions. Although obviously very easy to track, it may be worthwhile to also investigate the consequences of revoking Students' abilities to see \#class-selection once they have been sorted into their specific section.
