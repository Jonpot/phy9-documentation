# Creating Categories

### Creating a &gt; PHY9X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt; Category

This category should appear below the &gt; GLOBAL CHANNELS category, but above any &gt; PHY9X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt; \[ARCHIVED\] categories. It should also appear alphabetically among other &gt; PHY9X &lt;PROFESSOR&gt; categories. This category should be made private so that only @&lt;Professor&gt; and @&lt;Professor&gt; Student roles are given permission to **view, read, write, and connect** to channels in this category.
