# Creating Channels

### Creating an Average Channel

Simply pressing the "+" button next to the category name, typing the next of the channel, and selecting "text" or "voice" should suffice for most channel cases.

### Creating an Announcement Channel

After creating a text channel titled "\#announcements" in the new category, the permissions will have to be slightly tweaked. Revoke @&lt;Professor&gt; Students' ability to **write** messages in this channel, making sure to maintain permission for the associated @&lt;Professor&gt; to.

**Note** that Discord will bark at you for having channels that are "desynced" from the category's template. Do not worry about this, ignore it and don't click any buttons associated with it.
